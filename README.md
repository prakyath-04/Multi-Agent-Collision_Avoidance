# Multi-Agent-Collision_Avoidance

The repo conists of a link to the demo, showing the simulation of a multi-agent collision avoidance problem solved using time scaling alogorithm, which is a global algorithm followed by all the agents. If the agents follow the algorithms correctly, then there will be no collisions. The algorithm scales an agents velocity and accelration based on the scale of time. (assumes the agents travel at maximum speed when there are no other agents on the road/map, which is considered to be scale 1)
